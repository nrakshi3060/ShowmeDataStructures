Problem 6 : Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists

In this problem get_dict is implemented to convert the linked list to dictionary. Reason for using dictionary is it provides O(1) complexity to access the elements. Once it is converted to dict it becomes easy to perform union and intersection. Both union and intersection takes O(n) time complexity.
