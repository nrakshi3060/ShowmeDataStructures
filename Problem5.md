Problem - 5 : Blockchain

Block chain is implemented with LinkedList class. Linkedlist is intialized with head and tail set to none. Head points to the start of the chain and tail point the end of the chain. I have added append method to add a block to the end of the chain which takes O(1) time complexity and trversing the block takes O(n) time complexity.
Number of actively used nodes depends on the number of blocks in the chain. So the space complexity is O(n)
